Self-Training Electronic Vehicle for Exploration

STEVE is a fun little hobby project, combining an RC tank platform with a Raspberry Pi, Arduino Mega,
and plenty of sensors to allow him to discover the world.

The longterm goal is a robot which can autonomously navigate through environments in order to
reach assigned targets.
